=== Release 4.6.1 ===


2010-10-31  Mike Massonnet

Update test programs with Vala 0.10

GLib.Value can be boxed/unboxed by assignation/casting.
For example:

  Value var = 1;
  printf("%d\n", (int)var);

GLib.Object.get/set_data uses generics:

  widget.set_data("text", value);
  text = widget.get_data<string> ("text");

Fix two small mistakes in the autotools example

Pass the generated header file to the _VALABUILTSOURCES variable and
quit with an error within the autoconf script in case VALAC was not
found.

Bump to rc1

- Slight automake script update, clean new test programs and switch
DISTCLEANFILES to MAINTAINERCLEANFILES (make maintainer-clean).
- Default make distcheck doesn't pass with vapidir=/usr/share/vala/vapi
heance the autoconf script has a --with-default-vapidir flag but set by
default to false in which case the VAPI files are installed under the
default prefix.

More updates on exo-0.3 bindings

- Add a test file. It's mostly incomplete, it doesn't test any of the
widgets as they were very good introspected, the MountPoint class is
pretty annoying to use and I simply suggest "use GIO", and I didn't
succeed to use String.dup_strftime properly with a struct tm. The CCode
made use of 'tm' and not 'struct tm', might be a bug in the Posix
bindings... but anyway there are date and time functions in GLib.
- Fixed Binding classes.
- Fixed Md5Digest functions, moved str_get_md5_str to new class Md5.
- Fixed String class and some weak references.

Simplify the build when checking for Vala

Include new m4 macros in acinclude.m4 that are doing checks and
substitutions for Vala. Now a single m4 macro call is needed in the
autoconf script to check for Vala.

object in an external function, instead just unref() the object before
calling Xfconf.shutdown().

Remove version information consts from libxfce4gui

The version information is only useful in C sources, there is no way to
do #if LIBFOO_CHECK_VERSION (0,1,2) in Vala. So, out!

Update the test program to flush the RC data before opening it again for
reading. In fact, when creating the new instance, it is created inside a
temp var, then the original var is closed (=flushed too btw), and
finally the temp var is assigned to the original var. So, flush!

2009-03-17  Mike Massonnet

First commit with working libxfce4util bindings
