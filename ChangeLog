Make the panel plugin example a bit more complete

The plugin needs to call Gtk.main_quit() when it gets free'd or
destroy'd. I settled for the destroy signal cause it separates a bit the
logic of what do do on free or destroy. This is new, and if you don't do
this call, the wrapper process will still be around after you remove the
plugin from the panel.

Connected a few signal to populate the example and made the button an
action widget so it can be right clicked.

2009-12-22  Mike Massonnet

Update panel plugin example

No need to pull a directory inside the desktop file (bug #5455) and also
put an explanation about the plugin constructor.

2009-12-22  Mike Massonnet

2009-07-18  Mike Massonnet

Bump to rc1

- Slight automake script update, clean new test programs and switch
DISTCLEANFILES to MAINTAINERCLEANFILES (make maintainer-clean).
- Default make distcheck doesn't pass with vapidir=/usr/share/vala/vapi
heance the autoconf script has a --with-default-vapidir flag but set by
default to false in which case the VAPI files are installed under the
default prefix.

2009-07-18  Mike Massonnet

More updates on exo-0.3 bindings

- Add a test file. It's mostly incomplete, it doesn't test any of the
widgets as they were very good introspected, the MountPoint class is
pretty annoying to use and I simply suggest "use GIO", and I didn't
succeed to use String.dup_strftime properly with a struct tm. The CCode
made use of 'tm' and not 'struct tm', might be a bug in the Posix
bindings... but anyway there are date and time functions in GLib.
- Fixed Binding classes.
- Fixed Md5Digest functions, moved str_get_md5_str to new class Md5.
- Fixed String class and some weak references.

2009-07-16  Mike Massonnet

Simplify the build when checking for Vala

calling Xfconf.shutdown().

Remove version information consts from libxfce4gui

The version information is only useful in C sources, there is no way to
do #if LIBFOO_CHECK_VERSION (0,1,2) in Vala. So, out!

Update the test program to flush the RC data before opening it again for
reading. In fact, when creating the new instance, it is created inside a
temp var, then the original var is closed (=flushed too btw), and
finally the temp var is assigned to the original var. So, flush!
